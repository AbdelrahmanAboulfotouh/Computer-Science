# Hospital System
## About:
    My implementation to a simple Hospitals' classical systems.

## Brief description of the  project :

- The system has 20 different specializations, each with a queue of 5 available spots. 
- When a patient arrives, they must specify their specialization and their status (regular or urgent). 
- If the queue for the specified specialization is full, the patient is not added to the queue and is instead given an apology. 
- If the patient is regular, they are added to the end of the queue. If the patient is urgent, they are added to the front of the queue. 
- The system can print a list of all patients who are waiting for a doctor in a particular specialization. 
- When a doctor arrives to pick up a patient, they must specify the specialization of the patient they are picking up. 
- If there are no patients waiting in the queue for the specified specialization, the doctor is informed that there are no patients available. 
- Otherwise, the doctor is able to remove the patient from the queue and take them to see the doctor.
